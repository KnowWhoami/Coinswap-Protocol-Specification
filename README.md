# Coinswap Protocol Documentation

This repository contains the complete documentation for the **Coinswap Protocol**, a decentralized protocol for private and trustless cryptocurrency swaps. This documentation serves as a guide for developers, users, and researchers interested in understanding and implementing the Coinswap Protocol.

## Overview

The Coinswap Protocol enables participants to securely and privately swap digital assets without intermediaries. By utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques and atomic swap functionality, it ensures both privacy and security in transactions. This documentation provides an in-depth view of the protocol’s architecture, functionality, and implementation details.

## Contents

- **[Introduction](docs/introduction.md)**: Overview of the protocol's goals, motivations, and key features.
- **[Architecture](docs/architecture.md)**: Explanation of the protocol’s components, including atomic swaps, hashed time-locked contracts (HTLCs), and multi-party computation.
- **[Protocol Flow](docs/protocol_flow.md)**: Step-by-step breakdown of the Coinswap process, from peer discovery to atomic execution.
- **[Privacy Mechanisms](docs/privacy.md)**: Details on how Coinswap achieves transaction privacy and obfuscation.
- **[Security Model](docs/security.md)**: Explanation of the protocol's security assumptions, threat model, and mechanisms for counterparty protection.
- **[Implementation Guide](docs/implementation.md)**: Guidance on implementing Coinswap, including setup, dependencies, and configuration.
- **[Glossary](docs/glossary.md)**: Definitions of key terms and concepts in the protocol.

## Getting Started

To start exploring the Coinswap Protocol, we recommend beginning with the [Introduction](docs/introduction.md) and [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) sections, which provide foundational knowledge of the protocol and its goals.
