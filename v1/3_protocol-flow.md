# Protocol Flow

This section outlines the step-by-step process of a Coinswap transaction, detailing the actions taken by the taker, maker, and directory server. The protocol flow is divided into three main stages: initialization, contract execution, and completion. Each stage involves a series of interactions between the participants, culminating in the successful completion of the swap.

We will showcase the protocol flow in a scenario where we have one taker(Alice) and two makers(Bob and Charlie).

This completes the Coinswap transaction, with the coins successfully swapped between Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The protocol flow demonstrates the trustless and decentralized nature of Coinswap, ensuring secure and private coin exchanges without the need for intermediaries.
