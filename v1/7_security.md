## Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

A denial of service (DoS) attack is a type of attack where a malicious actor floods the network with a large number of requests, causing the network to become overwhelmed and unresponsive. In the context of Coinswap, a DoS attack could disrupt the swap process and prevent legitimate users from participating in the network.

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks

A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a type of attack where multiple compromised systems are used to flood the network with requests, causing a denial of service. DDoS attacks are more difficult to mitigate than DoS attacks because they involve multiple sources of traffic. In the context of Coinswap, a DDoS attack could disrupt the swap process and prevent legitimate users from participating in the network.

## Sybil attacks

A Sybil attack is a type of attack where a single entity creates multiple fake identities to gain control of the network. In the context of Coinswap, a malicious actor could host multiple maker servers and gain an unfair advantage in the swap process. To prevent Sybil attacks, the protocol introduces the concept of [**fidelity**](./4_fidelity.md)
