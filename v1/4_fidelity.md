# Fidelity Bonds

## Sybil Attacks

A Sybil attack is a type of attack where a single entity creates multiple fake identities to gain control of a network. In the context of Coinswap, a malicious actor could host multiple maker servers and gain an unfair advantage in the swap process. To prevent Sybil attacks, the protocol introduces the concept of **fidelity bonds**.

## What are Fidelity Bonds?

A fidelity bond is a mechanism in which a user deliberately locks a certain amount of bitcoin, making it costly to create a new cryptographic identity. The lockup is done in such a way that its value can be publicly verified. In the Coinswap process, takers are more likely to initiate coinswaps with makers who have staked more valuable fidelity bonds. This makes Sybil attacks significantly more expensive because an attacker would need to lock up a large amount of bitcoin to frequently be chosen as a counterparty in the swaps.

For makers, locking bitcoin as a fidelity bond can increase their participation in coinswaps and, consequently, their fee earnings. The most practical way to establish a fidelity bond is by sending bitcoin to a time-locked address using the opcode [OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Timelock#CheckLockTimeVerify). In this case, the "sacrifice" comes from the time-value of money, as the bitcoin is locked and unusable for a period. However, long-term bitcoin holders (or hodlers) can create time-locked fidelity bonds at minimal cost, assuming they donâ€™t plan to use their funds for transactions in the near future.

## Fidelity Transaction

The fidelity transaction is a time-locked transaction that locks the maker's bitcoin as a fidelity bond.

The redeem script for the fidelity output is constructed as follows:

```text
<pubkey> <OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY> <locktime> <OP_CLTV>
```

## Bond Value

The bond value is calculated based on the locked coins, interest rate, and locktime. The formula for bond value is as follows:

```text
bond_value = (locked_coins * (exp(interest_rate * locktime) - 1))^x
```

1. The bond value goes as the (locked_coins)^x of sacrificed value. For example if x is 1.3, the current default, and your sacrificed value is 5 BTC then the fidelity bond value is ~ 8.1. If instead you sacrificed 6 BTC the value is ~ 10.3. The point of this is to create an incentive for makers to lump all their coins into just one bot rather than spreading it over many bots. It makes a sybil attack much more expensive.
2. The longer you lock for the greater the value. The value increases as the interest_rate, which is configurable in the config file with the option interest_rate. By default it is 1.5% per annum and because of tyranny-of-the-default takers are unlikely to change it. This value is probably not too far from the "real" interest rate, and the system still works fine even if the real rate is something like 3% or 0.1%.
3. The above formula would suggest that if you lock 3 BTC for 10000 years you get a fidelity bond worth 2.03e+85 (~ 2 followed by 85 zeros). This does not happen because the sacrificed value is capped at the value of the burned coins. So in this example the fidelity bond value would be just ~ 4.17. This feature is not included in the above simplified equation.
4. After the locktime expires and the coins are free to move, the fidelity bond will continue to be valuable, but its value will exponentially drop following the interest rate. So it would be good for you as a maker to create a transaction with the UTXO spending it to another time-locked address, but it's not a huge rush (specifically, there's likely no need to pay massive miner fees, you can probably wait until fees are low).

## Fidelity Verification

The fidelity verification process ensures that the maker has locked the required fidelity bond. The taker can verify the fidelity bond by checking the fidelity transaction's locktime and the amount of bitcoin locked in the fidelity output. This verification process is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the swap process and preventing Sybil attacks.
