# Privacy

Coinswap was proposed as a privacy-enhancing protocol for Bitcoin transactions. This section explores the privacy features of Coinswap, including its impact on traceability, linkability, fungibility, confidentiality, anonymity, and privacy trade-offs. It also discusses privacy considerations, best practices, and tools that can be used to enhance privacy in the context of Coinswap.

## Traceability

Bitcoin transactions are inherently traceable due to the public nature of the blockchain. When coins are swapped using Coinswap, the transaction history of the coins involved remains visible on the blockchain.

By using the Coinswap protocol, the transaction graph is obfuscated, making it harder to trace the flow of coins between participants. This obfuscation is achieved through the use of time-locked contracts, hash preimages, and private key handovers, which ensure that the swap process is atomic and private.

## Fungibility

Fungibility is the property of an asset where each unit is interchangeable with another unit of the same type. In the context of Bitcoin, fungibility is essential for maintaining the privacy and security of transactions. Coinswap enhances fungibility by ensuring that swapped coins are indistinguishable from regular coins, making them more difficult to trace or blacklist.
